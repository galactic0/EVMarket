vogo,C DEEPKIRAN,17-Mar-20,"It's been a great 1 year using vogo . There were some really great experiences and some really bad ones too . So the two things which makes vogo far better to use than other services are : 1) Good Offers 2) Minimal charges on Pause Rides. The downside is the maintainence of the scooters in vogo zones . I see everyday that many scooters just lie there in vogo points and are not repaired for usage . Along with that , I have faced issues while driving because odometer is not readable .","Hey Deepkiran, We always try to make sure that the bikes are in a well-maintained condition and with fuel, and we are sorry if you did not find the same.
